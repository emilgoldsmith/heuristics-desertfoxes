Learning what values the other teams use.

wait longer when a crucial defence 14 (13) 0's and a 1

Make a "want" function

Finding first index where game can be won.

Play with 7 people

propose 2 player championship

make shit loads of calculations about that list
make winning strategy calculations
for example, for the next 4 they will need to buy me out
but they only have enough money to buy me out 3 times,
so then I will win.
do this in if conditions
maybe recursion.

Never bid for anything there's not a minimum of 3 of.

calculate max game length (15 of something) (average is 44 for 7 players)

Always consider worst competitor. 

don't buy someone out if it would make you lose

We want to either have more money, or have strong paintings.
Therefore, only bid as much as you would actually pay, if you either
have more money or stronger in paintings then it must nearly
certainly be that you're still better off if someone else wins it.

Binary search for bid that will give winning strategy if won.

Change the group numbers for the want function according to what other people bid.

Making things work for no matter how many opponents we have. 

Maybe making want function dependant on how much money we have.

Have to make that required dependant on the range

put in winning strategy at prevention

If you're winning with another painting convincingly, ignore everything else.

Change group amounts to also be able to go down
